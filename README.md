The top chart is a stacked area chart displaying monthly sales volume from 2014 to 2018. The blue area represents Consumer sales, orange represents Corporate, and red represents Home Office. It shows that Consumer sales dominate most months, followed by Corporate and Home Office. Peaks occur around year-end, indicating seasonal trends.
The bottom chart is a line chart showing total sales over time regardless of segment. It mirrors the trend seen in the top chart, with noticeable spikes toward the end of each year, highlighting consistent annual sales cycles.
This type of visualization is useful for understanding how different customer segments contribute to overall sales and identifying patterns or trends over time
